# Dogwater 

A low-rent Neovim color scheme loosely inspired by the "UnderTheSea" iTerm2
color scheme of [iTerm2-Color-Schemes](https://github.com/mbadolato/iTerm2-Color-Schemes).

This color scheme is implemented with the help of TJ's [tjdevries/colorbuddy.vim](https://github.com/tjdevries/colorbuddy.vim)

If you want to get right to brass tax, check out [`lua/dogwater.lua`](lua/dogwater.lua).

## Prequisites

Requires Neovim version 0.5 or greater.
